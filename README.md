# xkcd-redesigned

- https://xkcd-redesigned.herokuapp.com is a fun weekend project and an attempt to redesign a well known webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language called <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank">xkcd</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe" target="_blank">Randall Munroe</a>.
- The reason this project exists is the salient feature of left and right touch swipes. It loads comics for previous and next day respectively.


- Why proxy server?
  - Due to CORS enabled in the browser, had setup a proxy server which allows resources from the <a href="https://xkcd.com/json.html" target="_blank">xkcd API</a> to load.


- Tech stack:
  - React
  - Node
  - Tailwind CSS
